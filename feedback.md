## Technical Requirements

You did a great job using lots of features that required tech not covered directly in class... eg your use of auth[entication/orization],
many-to-many associations, ratings, and custom setter methods for tagging. Great job!

Evaluation: *Excelling*

## Creativity and Interface

You have a solid, logical interface for what is a pretty complex problem (esp for a Project 2). Good job here! My only
suggestions (were you to keep working on this), would be to explore ways to make the design more responsive. Right now it breaks
down a bit at narrow widths.

## Code Quality

I left a number of suggestions in the code, but overall your code is very clean and well-thought-out... great job! See the
inline comments for more.

## Deployment and Functionality

Your app has a significant level functionality for a Project 2! I can't, however, find a link to where it's deployed on heroku...
I'd mark this as excelling except for that one fact. (If you send me a link I can update this.)

## Planning / Process / Submission

Your wireframes and user stories (especially) are great! That said, your app is missing a readme and the ERD is out of date...
I strongly suggest updating those in case you'd like to share this is potential employers.
