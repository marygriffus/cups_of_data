As a user, I want to...

  < - Bronze Level - >

... add bras so that I can compare them to other ones.
... see bras that other people have added.
... see measurements of models' sizes (32C, 36DD, etc) so that I can choose bras that are right for me.
... rate bras in multiple categories (comfort, aesthetics, quality) so that I can make purchase decisions based on the criterion that matter to me.
... edit bra information so that if someone made an error I can fix it.

  < - Silver Level - >

... add reviews to bras to help other people make informed decisions.
... tag bras with recommendations so that I can help other people find bras that are right for them.
... browse bras by category so that I can more easily find what I am looking for.
... compare the measured sizes with 'standard' measurements so that I can see if I should size up or down.

  < - Gold Level - >

... log in so that I can save my preferences/information.
... find bras by similarity in sizing so that I can more easily find a good fit.
... give reviews up/down votes so that the helpful ones are more apparent.
